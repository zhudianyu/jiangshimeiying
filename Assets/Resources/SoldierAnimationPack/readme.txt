Soldier Animation Pack Notes

Hey, first off thanks for purchasing and using this pack!  

This pack was authored in Unity 3.5 so if you are using Unity4x you will get a prompt when importing the textures to 'fix' by converting to normal map, and you'll want to choose to ignore that.  The 'Import Type' should be left at 'Default'.

Please direct any questions, comments, issues, or requests to the Unity thread at: http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/186856-Soldier-Animation-Pack
